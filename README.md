# Empty repo, Use issue tracker for project ideas

This organization's goal is to create a POC implementing the latest market ready practices in web development.

Some high level tech goals are to make use of:
- ES6 + Babel
- node.js 4+
- Angular2
- Express
- Isomorphic (Universal) Javascript
- Gulp
- HTTP2 with SPDY fallbacks
- A node middleware
  - Pluggable authentication with basic/oAuth/LDAP support (CRUD for basic)
  - [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) and [JSON Schema](http://jsonschema.net/)
- Web + Hybrid Mobile outputs
- Full testability, including of the development tools and e2e testing
- Hability to transform it into an updatable yo seed
  - Probably by having some tools as independent npm modules
- Evergreen browser support
  - (Consider adding some IE fallbacks in the future)
